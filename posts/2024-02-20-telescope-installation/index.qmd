简单记录下 `telescope` 的安装，因为 <https://github.com/mlbendall/telescope> 提过的官方说明直接装后测试是有问题的。

一步步安装和debug过程：

```sh
mamba create -n telescope -c bioconda -c conda-forge telescope python=3.8
conda activate telescope
mamba install numpy=1.19
mamba install -c conda-forge -c bioconda 'pysam<0.17'
```

>现在回头看可以缩减为一句命令：`mamba create -n telescope -c bioconda -c conda-forge telescope python=3.8 numpy=1.19 pysam<0.17`。


测试：

```
