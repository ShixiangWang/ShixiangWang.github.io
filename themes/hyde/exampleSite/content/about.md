This is a "hello world" example website for the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@alanpearce/hyde](https://github.com/alanpearce/hyde) -- which was itself forked from the original Hugo port by [@spf13/hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde) -- and modified by [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://github.com/gadenbuie/hyde) following the guidance provided from [Yihui Xie's hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme).
