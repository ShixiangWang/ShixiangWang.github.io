talk_abstract: |
  Mutational signatures reflect the accumulated effects of both exogenous and endogenous mutational processes acting on cancer cells. Mutational signature analysis has been becoming a routine procedure after somatic variant calling in cancer genome study. Here we present Sigflow pipeline, which provides an one-stop solution for de novo signature extraction, reference signature fitting, signature stability analysis, and etc. in different types of genome DNA alterations.
