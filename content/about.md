Hello, my name is Shixiang Wang.
I'm a PostDoc at SYSUCC. Previously, I was a Ph.D. candidate at the [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) ([Xue-Song Liu lab](https://github.com/XSLiuLab)). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in cell biology from [CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science](https://cemcs.cas.cn/).

I'm a passionate R user and developer.
I build web apps using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), tools and packages using [R](https://r-project.org), and dynamic, interactive, reproducible reports using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
Browse my [list of projects](/project) for examples of my work, or review my [full curriculum vitae (resume)](https://shixiangwang.github.io/cv-shixiang/).

### Let's do something awesome together!
